## Insights & Recommendations

* **Declining Purchases & Calls**: A noticeable drop in both purchase volume and call frequency after April suggests possible customer churn or service dissatisfaction. Further investigation into customer feedback is advised.
* **Representative R02**: Handled the highest number of calls, but not the longest durations. Consider using R02's approach as a benchmark.
* **Consistent Average Call Duration**: Minimal variance among representatives indicates a uniform training standard.
